# Neo4j DataConnector For Power BI

Pretty much what it says on the tin. 

##How do I try it?

1. Put it into your PowerBI extensions folder
  (which appears to be: `<USER>/Documents/Power BI Desktop/Custom Connectors`) 
2. Allow Power BI to use beta connectors:
  Goto 'Options' in Power BI
  Select 'Security'
  Under the 'Data Extensions' heading select the radio option of:
  > (Not Recommended) Allow any extension to load without validation or warning

## Versions!

1.0 = Initial release
1.1 = Bug fix to get it working with Neo4j 4.0 MR2 (and probably onwards)
